# recipes_html_website
The recipes project is a mini project I did to work around with the basic HTML tags.
I utilized the basic HTML boilerplate along with header tags, anchor tags, images, 
order/undordered lists, links between pages and more.

Overall I learned the basic framework of HTML sites and got used to using different types of tags.
In the future, I look forward to learning to style my website better and learn how to change image sizing.
